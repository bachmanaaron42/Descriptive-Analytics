My Keurig only has the 8oz capacity and I took a cue from other users and run the bold k cups through twice to make 12 to 16 ounces depending on the type coffee.  Well even if I run this through twice at a total of 16 oz it is still too bitter... just not my k cup of coffee I guess but I do like Donut Shop and Newman's Own Extra Bold.\", 'I tried this product only because another brand (Oak Hill Farms raspberry tea concentrate) was no longer available on Amazon.  I regretted it after one sip:  the tea was very bitter and had no noticeable raspberry flavor.  The taste might be salvaged by a great deal of sweetener, but Oak Hill Farms required none.', 'I had no idea that I ordered 24 LOOSE Kcups.  This is a gift and it looks stupid...I guess I will put them in a gift bag???  I hope the person has a carousel.  Not impressed, hopefully they taste good.  Some are also dented because there was no padding or protection in the box.  NOT EVEN AN INVOICE!!!!', \"I'm an experienced gardener but thought I would extend my grow season.  Long story short....<br />paid a LOT for this system, herb plants were so wimpy and weak after two months.  called them and was told they had a problem with their nutrient tablets, sent out new ones.  One month later, string thin plants, no progress.  I purchased new lights $20 per set and a new flower kit for $25 and continued using distilled water and....nothing.  The new flower kit sent up a few very wimpy flowers, but mainly looked rangy and unhealthy.  ONe last try, bought new nutrients and still nothing much.<br />I am trying not to add up the kit, lights, nutrients, distilled water and time that went into a few flowers and a handful of herbs.  I grow 100 times that much in pots on my deck.<br />Also, its very important to note that I tried twice to post my reviews on their website and guess what? Disappeared.<br />They only post top rated reviews, no complaints welcome.  Kudos to Amazon, amazing that you can get the true scoop from others instead of a bunch of fake positive reviews, right?<br />Save your money, this is a gimmick,\", 'Not much to say here. Literally a cardboard \"shipping\" box filled with k-cups. Looked like somebody just grabbed a handful and just threw them in a box and sent them off. This may not bother some but to me this is poor presentation. I would have expected something similar to what you find in stores. An individual \"manufacturer\\'s\" type boxing sent in a shipping box. Frankly, I worried about the integrity of the product. How would I know who or where this product came from. For all I know someone picked them from a \"refused\" batch and simply threw them in a box and called it good. Additionally, upon further inspection the k-cups looked a little dirty. It appeared that they had collected dust. Not sure if this was due to the packaging or simply bad product. I guess that\\'s about it. I can\\'t really speak to the actual coffee itself since I didn\\'t try it.<br /><br />I should be fair and say, upon calling amazon with my concern they were happy to refund me entirely and asked that I dispose of the product since it\\'s a non-returnable item. I will be tossing this.', 'Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb Milk Chocolates Assortment<br /><br />Well...they sounded great to me! The reviews were great too! Off they went for Mothers\\' Day (shame on me). The \"giftee\" said they were \" the most ***awful chocolates I\\'ve ever had! I tried several...no carmels, no creams, no nothing!

After a 3 hour, $2000 surgery, it looks like she will be ok. Thank God. But the vet pulled huge chunks of this out of her stomach and intestine. So please do not let your dog have this. If you must, give them a dura chew.\", 'I remember when fruit rollups first came out--they looked and tasted like actual fruit.  This product in its present form certainly does neither now.  I bought 3 boxes, thinking it would be a good after-school snack.  After one try, all three boxes were thrown away, two unopened.  It may be true that there are still products out there that withstand the test of time and the all-mighty buck.  Alas, this is most certainly not to be one of them.', \"This toy definitely kept my guy busy. Unfortunately when he ate a chunk of it, it also kept my vet busy.<br /><br />I only allowed my dog to use this when I was around and gave it to him in the ball holder but he still managed to swallow a piece. It got stuck for a bit in his gut and caused him to throw up anything he ate and quite a bit of discomfort. Fortunately since this is a digestible item he was able to pass it without the need for surgery.<br /><br />My dog is a STRONG chewer and very determined, so you may have better lick, I mean luck, if your dog isn't so intent on liberating it from the holder.<br /><br />Also, if your dog has a Wheat/Corn/Soy allergy, be sure to test this with them before giving them the whole thing. I can't say for sure, but I suspect the package we had was NOT wheat-free b/c the boy reacted to it much like he does when he eats something with wheat in it. Unfortunately I didn't put that together in time to prevent what was described above.\", \"If you're loooking for a ready-to-drink shake, try a different brand. Over the course of two months I ordered two 12-packs of the Labrada shake. Delivery was prompt, but in both cases the whey protein and other solids in every carton had separated from the liquid, congealing into a chunk that couldn't be remixed by shaking the container for as long as a minute (as the manufacturer recommends.) In one instance, getting the contents out required slicing open the carton. Once the contents had been put into a blender, the shakes were satisfactory --- creamy. delicious and filling. But not RTD. If you're going to end up using a blender or shake bottle anyway, buy Labrada meal supplements in powdered form to begin with. I've found them equally tasty (although made with sugar,) equally nutritious and you'll be getting what you expected.\", \"This is a review for the Moon Rover Rescue toy.  While touted as one of their more durable toys, I found the plush toys to be more durable than this!<br /><br />I bought this as a replacement puzzle toy for one of my dogs, who adores plush toys and puzzle toys.  The second dog I have is more destructive and you really have to watch him with toys.  I was hopeful that the plastic would hold up better and the plush-lover would get more enjoyment out of his toy before it would get destroyed.<br /><br />The moon rover was much too difficult to get into (or out of) the moon; neither dog was able to retrieve it.  Within 30 minutes chunks of the moon were missing and the front part of the rover was chewed off as well.  Even though we're thorough, we were picking up chunks of blue plastic around the play area for a few days.  This purchase was a complete waste of $20.\", \"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.\", 'I have become more conscious of products with artificial sweeteners in them, and while the peach MIO tastes good, it falls within this \"strange chemical\" category that I choose to avoid, particularly because I am a woman of child bearing age. The third ingredient in this product is propelyne glycol, which is a petroleum-based chemical in the glycerine family, and variations of this are used in hair creams an cosmetics. There is also a sugar substitute that is 200 times stronger than sugar (acesulfame potassium) and is thought to cause cancer. No thanks!<br /><br />Its a shame because I like the overall concept and packaging of this product, and would be a great product if the the ingredients werent so scary.', \"Wow, I've never not liked one of the coffees or teas that are made for the Keuring...at least until now.<br /><br />Weak and flavorless and is the best I can say about this. You get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste. You do seem to get a bit of a bitter after-taste though. This may be due to how much the ice cubes melt during production. Frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre-made combination drink on hand.<br /><br />Brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation and it still made an extremely weak glass of tea.

I can't describe what it tastes like, but it is not chocolate or donut.\", \"This new pop up popcorn bag is EXTREMELY dangerous!!!  I did not use the popcorn button, rather I set the microwave to the indicated time (2.5 min) and the bag spewed hot oil all over the microwave, staining it.  This was the least of my problems because the microwave was SMOKING horribly from all sides when I came into the kitchen.  The smell lasted all day long and the microwave itself still smells very strong a day later, even after being cleaned.  This bag needs to be taken off of the market before it burns someone's house down.<br /><br />Again, I just cooked the popcorn for the specified time.  I cook regular popcorn at the specified package time and step away to go to the restroom and wash my hands all the time and never have a problem.  This product is scary!<br /><br />If you have this product, please return it rather than putting yourself, your home, and your family at risk.

It's basically a morning blend light roast, but just made too strong.  A bold ought to be a darker roast in my opinion.

The only hope for this coffee is that it will compost.\", \"I am a tea drinker and Love Earl Grey Tea. I was excited to enjoy my first cup of tea out of my Tassimo Machine. What I got instead was a weak, not tea at all, drink. It could have been dirty dish water I was drinking. There is no flavor at all to this product. I tried 3 more and they are all tasted the same. Waste of money, and tea drinkers will be clearly disappointed. Twinings should be embarrassed that Tassimo is representg their product in a low standard way! I now wonder if I should even bother with another type of tea!<br /><br />Don't waste your money. Stick with tea bags. My son got this for me for a gift so I could enjoy an easy cup of tea.

They tasted very bleh, and I agree with the other reviews I have seen other reviews it tastes like soap. Also since this was bought in the store instead of online. Because sometimes the online stores sell fake stuff. I followed the directions and even tried it without ice to see if I would like it better. Well it tastes horrible, I can describe it as unsweetened kool-aid fruit punch with a chemical taste like splenda sugar or something. Avoid this, I believe they had changed the formula.

I have two boxes (for my two cats), so I left the old litter in one box and stopped cleaning that one, then put Fresh Step Crystals in the other box. Theoretically, when the old box got gross enough, they would switch over to the new litter. Well, instead, they decided to switch over to going on the floor, next to the litter boxes. So gross. Needless to say I switched back to my old litter.<br /><br />I did notice these crystals feel a little sharp, so I don't know if my cats didn't use it because it hurts their paws or something. Or if it just looks too weird for them to be comfortable with. I have no clue if this litter tracks, or locks in odor, or if there is anything good about it.

Sorry, this needs to come off the shelf.\", 'This is the first product I have ever reviewed.  I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.  I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity.', 'I was really looking forward to having some good apple cider out of my Keurig machine. The cider has a wierd taste to it and a very bad aftertaste. After my wife and I both tried a cup, we ended up throwing the rest of it out.', 'This is the most horrendous mix I have ever used.  I have been gluten-free for two years now, and I was excited to see this mix.  It is significantly less expensive than other mixes.  Sadly, it tastles like potting soil smells.  I tried making the coffee cake recipe that one of the earlier reviewers loved, and it was rancidly bad.  I got goosebumps it was so bad--no lie.  Thirty minutes later I still feel that I should have daisies planted in my mouth.  Buy the Gluten-free Pantry flour.  It is pretty close to what I remember regular flout tasting like without the dirtlike aftertaste.', 'There\\'s a stark disconnect between the front of the product\\'s packaging (which promises \"Iced Green Tea\" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they\\'re drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that\\'s almost indistinguishable from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE\">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it\\'s got \"no aspartame\"--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this \"tea mix,\" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it\\'s one thing to emphasize a product\\'s naturalness (\"natural flavors,\" \"made with real ingredients,\" \"tea & honey,\" \"real fruit flavors\") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there\\'s one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: \"sweetened with honey.\" Let\\'s examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as \"Honey granules (sugar, honey),\" which means that there\\'s actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there\\'s as much honey as pure sugar, there\\'s only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton.', 'I purchased the peach and raspberry extract for flavoring iced tea. The propylene glycol in it tasted bitter and left an unpleasant taste for 30 minutes.

And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she\\'s a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.

It\\'s not Science Diet, that\\'s for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because \"it\\'s good for the cats and they love it\". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.

She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can\\'t do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.', \"Ok I know how beneficial all the ingredients are in this dry food are.

Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I\\'ve been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that\\'s it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can\\'t drink this!<br /><br />I don\\'t know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that\\'s had it\\'s top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it\\'s not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can\\'t believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That\\'s crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I\\'ve tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won\\'t realize this has declined in flavor, so it\\'s possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I\\'m updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it\\'s more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It\\'s lovely. Lovely! So, at least I\\'ve found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes \"just like\" young Thai coconut water. That it\\'s different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I\\'ve had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don\\'t recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin\\'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I\\'m coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren\\'t anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it\\'s just CW (not from concentrate) and it\\'s FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you\\'re carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is \"natural\" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian\\'s. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don\\'t buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they\\'d increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to \"optimize\" hydration benefits. So, it\\'s not just that it\\'s from concentrate, it\\'s \"optimized\" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don\\'t mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to \"optimize.\" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under \"Todd O\\'Connor\". ) I don\\'t know about y\\'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it\\'s great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don\\'t need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer\\'s profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That\\'s no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess.

However, I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', 'I commonly order jerky from all over the county. . .

You have to soak it in milk for at least ten minutes before it becomes palatable. (I suspect that it is the lack of fat that makes it this way).<br /><br />2) If you didn't read it on the package, you wouldn't really know there were apples in this.  There is no apple taste to speak of, and I'm not sure where they're hiding.  And if you didn't see the little dried pink strawberries, you wouldn't know there were strawberries in there either. It just tastes like granola -- nothing special.<br /><br />3) The bag isn't any good.  I realize this is taking the review to the extreme, but this stuff is packaged in a clear plastic that is difficult to open (and virtually impossible without scissors).  After you get that first bowl-full, you've gotta be careful to avoid creasing or ripping the plastic at the top of the open bag.  If you fail, the plastic tears down the side of the bag, and you have a big granola mess.

Red Star brand and Fleischmans (regular and fast rising) and the Hodgson Mill yeast in their bread machine mixes (the only other ones I have checked) yeast will rise and fill half the coffee mug.  (Fast risers fill the whole cup)  This brands increases its volume by just a little.<br /><br />I have also found that Red Star (regular, did not try the fast rise) yeast that is more than one year past its expiration date performs nearly as well as the fresh stuff.  Therefore I can say with the confidence of empirical evidence that Red Star yeast that is more than one year past the expiration on the package performs better (read: acceptable) than the packets of unexpired SAF yeast I have tried (read: unacceptable).', 'I ordered a box of power bar energy gels and the expiration date was only 8 months from the date of purchase', 'these are beef LUNGS...they are light and airy but did not agree w/my maltese digestive system so i gave them away.  stick w/smokehouse beefy sticks.', 'Just receive the noodle and try one.  The package looks similar but not the same as the one that I got from the Korean market.  I just finish the box of Shin noodle that I bought from Korean town so I know the differences right away.  I thought I got a good deal and save a trip to Korean town.  Guess not, I am wrong.  I am going to the Korean town this weekend to get the real stuff.  A little disappointed, I really want my authentic spicy red Korean Shin instant noodle tonight...<br /><br />This Shin noodle is made in the USA and it is a American version of the very popular Korean instant noodle.  This American version is only one-third as spicy and the noodle get soft and mushy very fast like the regular instant noodle.  The dry vegetable package does not go soft even after 10 minutes.  To use the dry vegs in the future, need to soak it for at least 30 minutes so the dry mushroom will get soft. The spice package is orange color, the real Korean Shin noodle is bright red in color and the noodle will not get mushy after 10 minutes.  I think it is something to do with the red pepper that the Korean use and not the picante in this USA version.  It is spicy but taste totally different than the Korean kind of red pepper which make it so special.<br /><br />Really want to return it but since I got it with the lightning deal discount, I will eat it like regular instant noodle to save the hazzle.  So beware if anyone reading this is Korean or have tried the real Korean Shin instant noodle.  This is not the real thing, do not order this and do not pay full price for this American version of the Shin noodle.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', 'I do not recommend this product , I had bought it to sprout,  out of whole cup full of seeds I only got 4 shoots of sprouts , I tried cup full 3 times , that means they have pretreated this with some chemical to give it self life or its GMO, if you wish to find out true quality of any seeds you buy sprout  some of it , if it sprouts well then you know they have not been messed with in lab , if they do not sprout means nutritional value has been taken out by some form of pretreatment , this was disappointment', 'When my husband brought in the delivered package with popcorn kernels stuck to the tape of the folded box and the sound of popcorn rolling around in the box...

I understand the idea behind this mate, and the better health reasons behind having it unsmoked and organic, which organic and unsmoked sounds like an amazing idea, especially since I prefer organic everything! The problem is that this mate tastes nothing like normal mate, and really doesn't have a good taste. There are a lot of Americans who when they drink mate out of a gourd and bombilla who think that it tastes like dirt. Well this mate is definitely a dirt earthy taste. It tastes nothing like a good crop of mate, this is highly agreed by my Argentinian friend who ended up throwing his purchase in the garbage just after 2 gourds full, and eventually I tried to struggle through this yerba, but in the end it was just too much for me. Waste of money, and the many Argentinians that are friends of the family want to stay away from this mate, when even they would prefer to drink organic as well. Sorry eco teas, but your crafty wording, and healthy image doesn't always mean it is good. I mean just because you have a pretty label, and you take out all the stalk from your teas does not mean they are truly better. The stalk is fundamentally part of yerba mate, as an image and why waste the other part of the plant right?

You can have your own opinions about MSG, but I think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways.<br /><br />They did taste great, though.

He didn\\'t think that transplanting the tree this soon after receipt would help since these trees need time to adjust to their new surroundings.

GMOs (genetically modified organisms) pose a danger to our environment and to human and animal health.  According to a newsletter article I recently received from Dr. Joseph Mercola (some of his stuff has to be taken with a grain of salt) Monsanto infiltrated the U.S. government in order to gain approval for its GMOs.  GMOs have never been studied for safety in humans.  They are banned in many European countries. Dr. Andrew Weil has come out against them.  In animal studies, they have been shown to cause organ damage and infertility.  Dr. Mercola said that theoretically they could cause the good bacteria in your intestines to produce pesticides.  Most of the soy, corn, zucchini, squash, canola and Hawaiian papaya are GMO. Honey can also contain GMOs. You have to carefully read labels as a lot of vitamins and supplements contain soy lecithin or soybean oil. Yesterday I went to Whole Foods Market in Paradise Valley and stopped at the adjacent yogurt shop called Zoyogurt.  I should have asked to see an ingredient list, but it didn't occur to me.  On my way home, I got the worst stomach ache.  When I got home I went to the yogurt shop's website and read the list of ingredients.  Corn syrup is the main sweetener. Most corn is GMO. Well, I won't be getting yogurt there again.  Also, Whole Foods Market is supposed to be GMO free, but the Cornucopia Institute did a study on breakfast cereals and found that Whole Foods 365 brand corn cereal contained 51% GMO corn.  Trader Joes has also said that its brand does not contain GMOs, but if there were GMOs in Whole Foods corn cereal, I wonder if I can trust what Trader Joes is saying.  Organic food cannot contain GMOs.  Farmers who do not want to plant these poison seeds on their land often have their crops contaminated by adjacent fields where GMOs are being grown.  Monsanto has sued and ruined many of these farmers for patent infringement.  We need legislation requiring the labeling of any product that contains GMOs.  Even honey should be bought organic as the bees that are allowed to feed on GMO crops transfer them to the honey.  The Environmental Working Group  has a link to a petition against them on their website.\", \"These Robbie Dawg snacks have been rejected to the extreme degree by every animal!<br /><br />I bought them originally for a cat whose who loves Temptations snacks. Not only did she not touch these, but when one of these was in her Temptations snack dish, she wouldn't even go near the bowl, as if this snack contaminated all in its vicinity.<br /><br />I next tried it on an outdoors cat who lives in the neighborhood. Since he lives the life of a homeless scavenger, one wouldn't expect him to be picky. Yet not even real hunger would make the bridge for him trying this.<br /><br />All right, how about dogs then? While this was made for cats, my experience is that many dogs will bascially eat anything you hand them (gulp it down first, and ask questions later).

These two rats eat brown rice as part of their daily diet and one of them in particular has a liking for fish.

I bet you can guess the outcome.<br /><br />All that is left to check, I think, is whether even the ants outdoors give the same answer....<br /><br />It is a major mystery what is going on here. One thing in my mind is that whatever is stated as the ingredients on the package does not correspond to what is in the product I received.

She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error.  I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore.  Which I did.  I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.  I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at amazon once I received the correct items.<br /><br />It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009.

Last time I bought this was in September of 2009, 3 flats for a total of 36 pieces.  I was about to reorder today and notice the price has gone through the roof, i.e., there has been a WHOPPING TWENTY-FOUR PERCENT INCREASE.  So I checked other websites which sell the individual, 3 oz. shakers.  Those prices are unchanged.  Next on the agenda:  check the Euro/dollar exchange rate.  In September of 2009, the simple average for the month was ~145 which is ~ where the Euro/dollar is trading now.  Mentioning the exchange rate, though, is only meant for purposes of example  Because Aromat is manufactured by Unilever which is a huge multinational corporation.  Therefore I am ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that they have currency hedges in place to avoid wild price fluctuations such as an ungodly 24%. Bottom line:  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE PRODUCT ITSELF TO HAVE HAD ANY WHERE NEAR THIS PRICE MOVE.  So I am going to chalk this up to increased shipping costs, noting that what used to be \"1 day shipping\" and \"2 day shipping\" are now more like 2 and 3-day, respectively.  On top of that, the #3.99 flat fee for what used to be true 1 day shipping was modified about a year ago to be #3.99 PER ITEM additional shipping even if they ship in the same box.  I also understand that signing up for regular, repeat shipping of an item does not \"LOCK\" the price in for the duration.  Amazing.  These not-so-subtle changes over time tell me that we can expect more of the same across the board.  And as consumers, we have to make hard choices. Because next on the agenda, the States will likely push for taxes.  Add that on top of the wildly escalating cost of shipping and it won\\'t make sense for me to do so much on-line shopping because convenience can only offset so much of the cost. And that threshold is approaching fast. I am now exploring ordering this item in bulk directly from Europe.  It used to be available here in 2.2 lb. packages (1 kilogram)but that was discontinued.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', \"I purchased this as a gift for someone who said the meat was bad. I was disappointed that I sent it as a gift.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this.

The filling just sticks inside the cookie and stays there when you break it in half. Not gooey at all (though I'm not even sure that would have helped). The flavor is totally artificial and sickeningly sweet with, as I have already mentioned, a very nasty aftertaste that lingers.

I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', \"Isn't this a rip-off?

My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler.  Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.\", \"Tried Mudslide and Chocolate Glazed Donut.  Both were horrible, dumped them down the sink.

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she\\'s a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It\\'s not Science Diet, that\\'s for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because \"it\\'s good for the cats and they love it\". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to \"fatten her up\" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can\\'t do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.', 'Did you notice the price difference between this and competors??

I decided that I couldn't trust the packaging. I am sure there was bacteria the container that burst and I was afraid to trust the rest since I bought additional packages of the same flavor.

He finally started to act relaxed, and then his eyes lost all life - I thought I was watching my dog die in front of me.<br /><br />Luckily, this event subsided, and he went back to normal. About 30 minutes after the seizure, he had a full bowel movement. Later, he ate a regular dinner and had another regular bowel movement, so that told me it wasn't a blockage.

In the mean time, hold off on ordering this food until Amazon can assure us that they will not send tainted products.

The holistic, grain-free food is made by the same company.<br /><br />And today comes word that, indeed, Diamond Pet Foods has issued a recall of a limited run of Taste of the Wild dry dog food over concerns about possible Salmonella contamination.<br /><br />According to the press release:<br /><br />To determine if your pet food is recalled, consumers should check the production codes on the back of bags. Any production codes that have a number \"2\" or a \"3\" in the 9th or 10th digit and an \"X\" in the 11th digit in the production code should be discarded. The best before dates are December 9, 2012, through April 7, 2013.<br /><br />The recall affects only products distributed in the following U.S. states and Canada. Further distribution to other pet food channels may have occurred.<br /><br />Alabama<br />Florida<br />Georgia<br />Indiana<br />Kentucky<br />Massachusetts<br />Maryland<br />Michigan<br />Mississippi<br />New York<br />North Carolina<br />Ohio<br />Pennsylvania<br />South Carolina<br />Tennessee<br />Virginia<br />Canada<br /><br />Pet owners who are unsure if the product they purchased is included in the recall, or who would like replacement product or a refund, may contact Diamond Pet Foods via a toll free call at 1-866-918-8756, Monday through Sunday, 8 am - 6pm EST.

This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I\\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I\\'d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart\\'s content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it.

The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) Water sufficient for processing, fish, poultry, meat by-products, wheat gluten. How disgusting is that?! \"Fish\" and \"poultry\"?? Not really sure how that can be counted as an ingredient...not \"tuna\" or \"salmon\" but \"fish.\" Not \"chicken\" or \"turkey\" but \"poultry.\" If it was a decent quality meat- they wouldn\\'t feel the need to hide behind ambiguous terms. Then there\\'s the by-product which is the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We\\'re talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, pure, meat, and there just isn\\'t real identifiable meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip! I'm trying to avoid another vet visit but we're not in the clear yet). Even the stray cats on the block won't touch it and they pretty much eat anything. Definitely won't be trying it again.\", 'I would have given 5 stars to the original (Made in Ceylon). Those were very refreshing, had taste and texture to it. But the once I got in mail second time around are not any thing like original.

I assume that the larger and smaller ones are fine, but my pug who weighs about 16 lbs (within the 11-25 lb suggestion) could not swallow the chew and got it stuck in her throat (after she chewed it until the point when it got wet and pliable). Thank god that my wife and I were in the living room to witness the accident. My dog fell over in convulsions while choking and my wife physically yanked the chew out of the dog's mouth. I think that this sized chew is very dangerous and you should think twice before purchasing it. If you do have a similar dog and want to buy this product, please supervise him/her!\", 'I don\\'t know what the other reviewers prepared as a filler for their tarts -- clearly one can hide their taste (petroleum and preservatives) with something rich and robust -- but why try.  You get what you pay for, and with this item, you get something akin to cardboard.  I\\'m sure that their shell life (atomic half life) is somewhere around 200 years, so if we ever have to back to stocking fall-out shelters, this is the item you\\'ll be looking for.<br /><br />I purchased a case to try out in preparation for a catering I was planning, and handed a cup to my girlfriend who is a non-chef.  Her first comment on the taste was \"petroluem.\"  On the plus side, I can\\'t imagine these cups every springing a leak or getting soggy.  In fact, I can\\'t imagine that my body could digest them once swollowed.  Save your money and order unbaked pastry cups shipped overnight on dry ice by Dufour Pastry Kitchens in the Bronx.  They have a wide variety -- including blue corn, and they are not only digestable, but taste good.', \"It took forever for fruit to flower - two of the three plants fruited, grew nice-sized tomatoes, but the weight caused them to topple.  Next, the leaves all rotted off but the remaining fruit ripened...bland, ugh, no taste.  The remaining plant finally grew fruit and they ripened red with tons of tape, etc. to support it (that's where all the extra work came in - trying to keep the plant upright).  Taste on these was a little better but far from worth the effort.  Back to herbs!!!

I ended up eating something else with taste for the rest of my dinner because this was so bad....\", \"I have tried this in many different recipes, all to my dismay and wasted ingredients... It always comes out the same.  It tastes like serious chemicals and is so gross it overpowers everything else.  This is SOOO NOT worth the money or time!  If you're looking for a totally all natural sweetener just buy a lb of dates in the veggies section of your store, cut them in half and take out the pits/stems, soak them in like a cup of water over night (covered well over) then blend them in your blender/food processor. It will make a thick paste that you can store in a jar/container in your fridge for a couple weeks.  I know that may sound like more trouble, but really? You'd be waiting for these things in the mail and when they arrive, I know you'd be dissapointed. Dates are chemical/sugar free, all natural and totally sweet so they DO work in many recipes and even coffee/tea.  Dates, now, after trying many, many sweeteners ( I have a serious sweet tooth) are the ONLY thing I will endorse that is remotely safe for your body and also tastes GREAT.  Peace, hope this helps...\", 'Unfortunately it arrived completely stale.<br />There is something seriously wrong with their specific batch as it had a second label over the box.

The end had been cleanly cut from that box and then re-fitted over the opening, without being taped. Inside the Roland box were 24 damaged cans. Not a single can was not damaged in some way, the majority of them being severely dented. The sheer number of damaged cans, and the variety of that damage, in an undamaged box, was such that we concluded these were previously damaged cans collected into the case container we received. We contacted Amazon and their response was immediate and gratifying, as has always been the rule with them.

I'm having this debate with a coworker that Nestle Pure Life purified water tastes different than Ozarka spring water.  I like Ozarka natural spring water but can't stand Nestle Pure Life.  He showed me that Ozarka is a division of Nestle and it was all in my head, that the bottles are identical but just have different labels.  Looking closer at the labels, I see what the difference is.  The Nestle Pure Life is basically distilled water with added minerals.  So I wouldn't buy it unless you don't mind the taste of distilled water.\", \"I have used quality salts for years, and have always especially loved the pink salt variety, so I ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there. Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this  salt, so I will purchase a different brand.\", \"Eating this oatmeal was a truly horrible experience. It has an overwhelming artificial sweetner taste that destroys any of the other flavors. To top it off, looking at the nutritional info it doesn't seem like the flavor trade off is worth it.<br /><br />You are better off with plain oatmeal with some fruit in it.\", \"Checking nutrition info on this product today at the Eugene, OR Costco, these snacks appeared to be remarkably healthy for a fruit snack. I did a double-take, and  a triple-take on the number of servings per box. Number of servings is triple the number of pouches in the box! Serving size = 9 pieces. If the snackers in your world are sufficiently disciplined, or smallish of appetite, to be satisfied with a third of a pouch of fruit snacks, bon appetit!<br />Sidebar: If you could be so polite as to not add to Costco's excessive packaging habit by re-packing your fruit snacks into Baggies-of-Nine, well, that would be appreciated and more power to you.\", \"The product arrived in fine shape.

I'm a certified personal trainer and distance runner and this product did not live up to my expectations. I'd tried the regular canned form, and moved onto the powder.

I am in no way an expert, but I drink green tea and have tried many different kinds. I found this one to be my least favorite. It's very confusing. It's not matcha.

I mean, you wann \\'em, and if you play your cards right over time, you gott \\'em. But ahh, the catch.  If you don\\'t use \\'em, you might just lose \\'em.  What\\'s all of this have to do with fruitcake?  Well, sans any fruitcake jokes, please stand by...<br /><br />Recently, I\\'ve lost a couple of hard-earned credit cards, due to \"lack of use.\"  Really?  I mean, really?!!  Is this what America has come down to?  I do all I can to establish or re-establish my basic U.S. dollar, human worthiness for unsolicited credit card offers, only to get a few, only to lose out when I don\\'t use them for awhile?  Without warning.  ZAP!  They\\'re gone.  Seems \"they\" want you to have the cards, but if you go overboard with them, they hound you to no end, but then, if you don\\'t use them, or even forget you had one, they cut you off and cancel your card.  Fruitcake, I say!  Fruitcake!<br /><br />So it was, after I learned these things and more, that I told myself, with one card, hey, I better USE this or LOSE it.  Having nothing really I wanted or needed at the time (all you NEED is love...), I ordered this product from Amazon.  Through one of those cards I feared losing soon, unless I used it.  But after ordering, receiving, and trying this particular product (some supposed \"gourmet\" fruitcake), I can only report that this was/isss overall, much less than I expected.  In other words, this is pretty bad fruitcake, in my opinion, and for the price, really bad.  If you are at all in my situation, I strongly suggest that you use any under-used credit card funds or other \"disposable income\" on something else.  Cause this is pretty bad fruitcake.<br /><br />Now, before you cut me to the quick, and question either/or my knowledge and experience of/with said fruitcake product, let me just say that I\\'ve been getting fruitcakes as gifts (usually around Christmas), for a long, long, long, long time.  Ever since I care to remember actually.  I think I remember that once upon a time, I casually mentioned to family, friends, or others, that I liked fruitcake.  I actually, generally LIKED fruitcake.  Well, soon the word spread, and I\\'ve been given them by family, friends, or other over the ages.  Not that I\\'m complaining, because I DO LIKE FRUITCAKE!  There, I said it all.  But...this particular fruitcake brand?  Fairly average at best, but compared to the cost, pretty awful.<br /><br />Oh, believe me dear readers and followers, I WANTED to like this.  I really did.  An impulse buy at the time, all I wanted really was some half-decent fruitcake and an inexpensive means to keeping a credit card alive and kicking.  Well, big, impulsive mistake, because, according to my taste, and my own decades-long relationship with fruitcakes in general, this is not very good.  And it is only my history of loving almost EVERY fruitcake I\\'ve ever had, which guides to you, my fellow fruitcake lover, away from buying anything more than a sample of this product.  And please don\\'t make the mistake I made when I ordered taste-unseen, three single fruitcakes, when the purchase of even one would\\'ve told me the story here.<br /><br />I realize with this review that I may go against the grain (though not fiber-wise) in dissing this, but I\\'m just coming from a long history of fruitcake enjoyment and this doesn\\'t even come close in quality, taste, and otherwise, to fruitcakes enjoyed past, present, and future.  Heck, this isn\\'t even \"cake\" at all.  It\\'s like this big, thick, DOUGH, with TOO many TOO sweet \"fruits,\" and the nuts were pretty dry and unmemorable.  Heck, I don\\'t even LIKE sweets generally.  I\\'d much rather have a bowl of cheese crackers or chips than a bowl full of M&M\\'s or Reese\\'s peanut butter cups or chunkey monkey or any other such sickenly sweet thing.  But heck, just about the ONLY sweet I\\'ve ever really loved, was/is fruitcake.  So, why was/is this so disappointing, and so overpriced?<br /><br />I think this is the fruitcake equivalent of fruitcake DOUGH.  Like cookie-dough ice-cream, which I\\'ve always thought too weird and not really concentrating on the essentials.  This is like eating fruitcake DOUGH, before any baking.  And that, ain\\'t good.  Fruitcake should be CAKE, not uncooked DOUGH.  And that\\'s what this is really.  In the end, wholly unacceptable, and to go technical on you\\'all, pretty darn yucky, you betcha!  Only my opinion...try a sample before ordering anything more than that.<br /><br />Judging by the generally favorable opinions about this specific fruitcake I\\'ve found here on Amazon, I may never know if this is just me, or what.  This has generally high reviews, but I only managed to finish ONE of the THREE individual pounds I ordered and was sent (and btw, Amazon delivered nice and fast and easy as usual), and was just gonna GIVE the rest away, but I think I would\\'ve felt guilty about subjecting anyone else to this, so I just threw the other two pound \"cakes\" away.  Maybe the rats or worms will like it, I don\\'t know.<br /><br />Basically, to make a long, boring, but hopefully humorous story short, I suggest buyer beware on this, and buy/try the smallest portion/size you can.  If you like this thick, tasteless in many ways, un-fruitcake, by all means, purchase away.  But I can\\'t give this any kind of enthusiastic thumbs up, as far as fruitcakes go.  And wouldn\\'t ya know it, the instructions for use are virtually non-existent, with no manual, no software, and little documentation as to why and how I\\'m supposed to actually enjoy this doughy mess.  And no real warranty!  Fruitcake lover/buyer beware...<br /><br />To all fellow outcast, strange dog, hopelessly romantic, secret fruitcake lovers, my small minority brothers and sisters who KNOW good fruitcake from bad, let me just say that this is nowhere near worth the asking price.  To those of you who\\'ve tried this and actually liked it, I can only suggest you expand your fruitcake worldview and experience to other brands because this just ain\\'t that good.  A cheap dollar store variety is better than this, IMHO.  One thing for sure though, next hardly used credit card purchase goes to another gift card for someone else, for something other than such a bad product as bad as this...', 'I bought these from a large chain pet store. after reading the reviews I checked the bag... made in China.

Googledee peck, peckity google.<br />Identify malefactors. It\\'s not so easy catching the little buggers on the fly so I bought both the Propest and the Safer sticky catchers. $40 worth from Amazon.<br />It appears I have plain Clothes Moths. Light brown wings, less than 1/2\" long. No mottling on wings.<br />Both moth catchers I received, are triangular open cardboard tubes with the sticky lining inside and their own little tiny strip of bug alluring super secret squirrel perfume inside. Did taxpayer money fund the research for this secret stuff? We want to know.<br />Neither brand captures all flying moths like a magnet as at least one reviewer has stated. In fact, if you snore through the lit, only male moths are snagged. Mommy moths are laying eggs all over the place. Yeaah, Grrrrrh.<br />You don\\'t have to be a brain surgeon to notice that moths fly like drunken sailors. Amazingly, in the course of a week, two Propest tubes each caught a dozen moths. Two Safer tubes were almost useless. One caught 2 moths and the other caught none. I moved all of them around a little every day. The Propest tubes are twice as big as the Safer ones and I think this is a factor.<br />I, as a senior citizen, am on board to try to do the Green thing as much as possible. Clearly however , once moths are flying all over your house, you are not going to get rid of all traces and iterations of them with any shade of Green song and dance, pyramids, good vibrations, force of argument and certainly not the inevitable cursing. Very much alive female moths, now bigger, flew around my face annoying me and raising my blood pressure to dangerous levels.<br />Killing all the boy moths is productive and fine with me but leaves, presumably, an equal number of maybe pregnant and/or very horny mommy moths. Hmmm, maybe a plot for a Japanese horror flick.<br />The last time I had moths, 15 years ago, long and short, I used pesticides to finally rid myself of these pests.

However, it is a fact that the vast majority of corn based Xylitol found in North America is imported from China.

For that one day, her bowl remained untouched and my little puggie was constantly begging for our food during our meal times.

I work and have very little spare time to spend in the kitchen, so I loved being able to steam and puree my baby's food without having to clean multiple pots and pans. Then, after about a month of regular use, I noticed a foul odor coming from the well where the water goes. I looked inside and saw that a brown crust had formed there. I figured it must be lime deposit that had turned brown from being exposed to the hot temperature of the babycook, but when I tried to descale the well, the vinegar did almost nothing to remove the brown deposit, even after several attempts. I was also very worried to see that the water that ended up in the steamer basket was brown, thus suggesting that if I tried steaming more veggies, the deposit would end up in my baby's food.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they recommended using distilled water (although there was no mention of this in the manual). So, I exchanged my now completely dysfunctional Babycook for a new one, and tried again. Within two days the brown film had developed, even though I was using distilled water. I don't know much about appliance design, but I figure there must be something really wrong with this gadget if it takes only a few days for such a deposit to form. And the odor is truly foul - no way I want my baby's food within a foot of whatever it is that collects there.<br /><br />I don't see any mention of this problem in other reviews, but at the same time, I can't imagine that I am the only person this has happened to, given that it happened TWICE to me.

Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever.

The delicate wafers themselves are dry and crisp.  Their taste seems nothing too special if you eat them straight -- but being layered and covered with whipped cream and a few hours in the refrigerator brings about an easy transformation into a luscious and intense chocolate experience.  There is no refrigerator dessert close to it.<br /><br />But today\\'s packaging is less protective of these wafers than were the long metal cylinders with screw tops that protected those of my childhood memories. I often need to sort through the boxes on groceries shelves to find ones with no more than one or two broken wafers.  So I welcomed a chance to buy a carton. Closely packed and sent straight to me, I told myself, they would arrive intact, and I\\'d have a supply for many impromptu dinner parties.<br /><br />WRONG.  The unexpectedly large carton that arrived today proved to be part of a naive attempt at the double-boxing often used to ship fragile things. Unfortunately, Amazon\\'s packer didn\\'t really understand the concept.  The only cushioning included in the ample spaces between that large carton and the inner one with the wafers was one strip of 4 plastic pouches partly filled with air.  The inner box seemed to have been bouncing around a lot during transport, by the glimpses of the number of broken wafers in the boxes inside. I braced myself to go to the trouble of sending the order back -- I can find less damaged ones (at a lower price) on local shelves.<br /><br />And guess what?  After filling out a feedback report on the packaging problem, I went to arrange a return -- and was told that the product in that order was not returnable.  No reason given, and no warning on the listing either.<br /><br />Now I can understand that Amazon has no use for 12 boxes of damaged wafers.  But you know something?  Neither do I.<br /><br />Yes, I hope Nabisco continues to be carry them forever.  But I\\'ll get mine locally from now on, and suggest that you might be wise to do so too. You can grate one broken wafer over the top and add an extra bit of that wonderful chocolate taste as well as a nice contrast to the white of whipped cream.

They both enjoyed EVO and the ingredients are very similar to what is in CORE.

Also, a 12lb. bag of CORE is about the same price as a 15.4lb. bag of EVO, so CORE winds up being more expensive. Though it is more convenient to just go to PetCo to buy the CORE than it is to go to the specialty feed store to buy EVO.<br /><br />Bottom line: both are excellent dry cat foods, and I will probably wind up rotating between them. Since they are outdoor cats, I plan on feeding them EVO as the weather gets colder so they can build up a layer of fat for the winter, and Core when it\\'s warmer and they don\\'t need as much insulation.<br /><br />UPDATE (10/21/2012): One of our cats started having urinary tract problems.

This one is awful for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  Flavor: it is barely \"spicy\", more sweet than hot.<br />2.  Texture: unlike the other jerkies this one is a lot thicker and comes out like a slab - the others tend to break up easily and are a lot more moist - it is nothing like \"real\" jerky which I still recall after 20+ years as a vegetarian.  There is nothing jerky-like about the texture - think of a piece of cardboard it\\'s about that thick, dry, and very unappealing.<br />3.

Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.

Just so you know, you won't easily be able to detect the mold except by taste.  It shows up adjacent to the apples, and in the cinnamon strip in the center of the cake.<br /><br />The one star that I had to give it was merited, however.  I did not get sick from eating some of a piece of the coffee cake ... the phenolic flavor of which caused me to pull apart the cake, and identify that gray fuzziness which hallmarks mold.  No diarrhea.  No puking.  Well worth one star.<br /><br />My story.  The week after Thanksgiving (2009), I received one of these coffee cakes as gift from my aunt.  According to the label, she had purchased it the first week of November 2009 at Walter Reed Hospital (military) commissary.  After detecting the mold, I resealed it in its packaging material, what the company describes as a reusable freezer bag.  I placed it in my freezer, including the outer box, anticipating sending it back to the company for examination.<br /><br />A note about the packaging.  When I first opened the coffee cake's box, the inner (reusable freezer) bag conformed tightly with the cake, and the tape sealing the bag was undisturbed.  While the flyer included with the coffee cake advises that the product is stable for up to a year, I believe this could be overly optimistic if the mold eats cake quickly.  On the bright side, as the mold progresses, it's likely to become more visible during the course of a year.<br /><br />Know that if you don't heed my warning you're on your own.  The company will not stand by their product.  When I called their 'customer service' number, the woman advised me to return it to the military commissary where my aunt purchased it.  Not being in the military, I can not get on the facility within which the commissary is located.  Further, I'm not the boorish type, so the idea of returning the gift to my aunt as inedible was not an option.<br /><br />As we spoke, the customer service woman asked me 'if I had a problem with Campbell's soup would I call Campbell's soup, or take the soup back to the grocery store?'  I'd get in touch with Campbell's about defective soup ... if for no other reason than to allow them to recall the product.  Bottom line, she could no nothing for me as I had not bought the coffee cake directly from My Grandma's.<br /><br />When I related to the customer service woman that I would endeavor to communicate my dissatisfaction with their product, and their customer service, to the extent that I was able, she put me on hold.  Twice she came back on the line, asking me to continue to hold ... advising that held calls could only stay on hold for a short while.  The call disconnected after this.  There was no discussion on either of our parts with respect to the desired resolution.  My only option was to return it.<br /><br />With natural foodstuffs, especially those not chock-full of preservatives, it seems likely that problems might crop up every now and again.  I would've been content to ship the coffee-cake back to them (at their cost) to let their experts determine what was wrong, how it likely happened, and whether or not a recall was indicated ... after which I would've hoped for a replacement coffee cake.<br /><br />The crappy customer service ensured this didn't transpire.\", \"Did not like this.  I threw 95% of it away.  It is very thin slices of marlin covered in sugar and soy sauce.  All I was tasting was sugar and soy sauce masking the marlin flavor.  The jerky also had so much sugar that it was sticking together in the package.

Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.

After all, I have had quite the cavity problem over the years and I figured I had to do something to save my dentist the despair that struck over his face every time I walked into his office.<br /><br />Nearly immediately upon receiving them I took the bag with me down to my home theater and ripped them open with a child-like craving.  I popped them in my mouth one by one, careful to roll them around with my tongue and over and back and fro between my gums, lips and tongue.  I relished how soft and plyable they were and the taste was exquisite.  I could not believe that I was experiencing nirvana from a sugar free product.<br /><br />About an hour into the movie however, things started to change and before long, it was as if the gates of he11 opened up in my room.  I could almost swear I saw the hand of Bealzibub himself reaching forth from the depths of a gaping, red fissure that had become of my rectum, claws and all scraping any which way they could to cause pain.

I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here\\'s the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn\\'t be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he\\'s not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That\\'s about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a \"fair shake\", and to make sure that I didn\\'t just wind-up with a \"bad batch\" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat \"favorites\" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can\\'t blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I\\'m not sure I even want to know what goes into \"fish broth\", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food.

I couldn't figure out what I'd eaten that would create such a terrible response-tomatoes, fennel, salad and onion should not cause any problems- and then I thought about the bullion. So I checked out the ingredients on the bullion, and I should have known it would contain MSG (if you aren't scared of MSG yet, go google it).

After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill\\'s company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula\\'s first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat\\'s don\\'t need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don\\'t need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it\\'s pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren\\'t that expensive to source.  What\\'s worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill\\'s website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That\\'s completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to \"see the light\" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet\\'s ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn\\'t process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn\\'t the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature\\'s Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat\\'s diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.

I do not waste so I will keep drinking it but I will never buy it again.', \"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.\", 'I purchased two bags of this dogfood, after one week of feeding the newman brand, my dog started vomiting after eating, she had gas all the time and lied around whimpering due to stomach ache, after having her checked for a stomach disorder, I took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappeared.<br />I have sent three emails to newman dogfood website, no replies or acknowledgement, phone number not available, the dogfood is expensive and THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT.', 'This pepper was so old it made all my food taste like I put in ground chalk.

The difference is like night and day: the Lavazza pods are disgusting! Compared to the espresso I can get from a Starbucks pod, and also compared to the espresso I can get in any coffee shop in town, the shots produced by the Lavazza pods are watery and tasteless. They're not simply 'marginally' worse than the Starbucks pods. The espresso produced by the Lavazza pods has a hideously bland taste, to the extent that it pains both me and my wife to drink them (which is surprising, because neither she nor I have particularly demanding taste buds).<br /><br />The first problem with the Lavazza pods is that they include a LOT of excess filter material around the pod, which prevents the espresso machine from making a good, water-tight seal and results in water dripping out of the brewing chamber.  We experimented at great length with trimming away the excess material on these pods to try to get a better espresso.  With some finesse (by trimming excess filter and carefully positioning the ESE pod in just-the-right spot), it is possible to get a good seal.  Once my wife and I accomplished this, the quality of our Lavazza espressos improved dramatically...but was still light-years behind what we expected.  No matter how hard we've tried, we can't get a good shot of espresso from these pods (and we've tried manually tamping them, trimming excess filter material, making sacrifices to various caffeine-related deities, and even performing special brewing dances to appease the coffee gods).<br /><br />Our advice:  AVOID LAVAZZA ESE PODS AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!  You can find incredibly better alternatives at a 10-20% higher price point!\", 'Unfortunately seller did not list ingredients in Product Features or Product Details and I incorrectly assumed it would be like other Furikake Urashima products.

I emailed the company and they tried to assure me that they are positive their chinese product is of the highest quality and the reason for the apples coming from china when there are apple orchards in their backyard (I've driven by the plant and apples grow all over around there) is because there are no freeze drying facilities in the us. This doesn't make any sense because I checked a package of mountain house freeze dried apples and they are made in the us from us produce.<br /><br />If buying chinese produce doesn't bother you then these are for you, they do taste good but if you're concerned with the huge amounts of less safe pesticides used in china and with the questionable quality of chinese food products then steer clear.\", \"Shipped quickly and packed well.

I am a (recent) former user of Evanger\\'s pet food products, and have no affiliation with them, or with anyone else in the pet food industry.  I deeply regret having ever fed any animal Evanger\\'s products, especially animals I love and care for.  Of course, you must do your own research and draw your own conclusions about these matters.  Evanger\\'s has made an explanation of their side of things in some of these matters, although I personally found their \"reasons\"  entirely unconvincing.<br /><br />I would strongly urge you to research this company for yourself.  In particular, read about the FDA\\'s revocation of their permit for failing to process the food properly, and read about the arrest of the owners on charges that they committed millions of dollars worth of utilities fraud by operating their plant for years with the gas and electric meters bypassed.  If, as alleged, they were operating with stolen utility service, what shortcuts would they be willing to take with your pet\\'s health and safety to reduce manufacturing costs?  And in the vein of cutting costs, read about the successful lawsuit by employees for just under half of a million dollars in unpaid overtime wages.<br /><br />I can\\'t post web links here, but my sources include a Chicago Tribune Article dated March 25, 2010, titled \"Lincolnwood couple charged in utility theft scheme\" and two articles on the FDA web site entitled \"FDA Orders Pet Food Maker to Obtain Emergency Operating Permit\" and \"FDA Suspends Temporary Emergency Permit of Pet Food Maker\".  I would also mention the lawsuit against Evanger\\'s by their employees, which Evanger\\'s appears to have lost.  (Source: web site \"Truth About Pet Food\") The Northern District of Illinois Distric Court, Case: 1:09-cv-00227, filed 9/15/2010, Final Approval Order Francisco Barragan and Liberto DeLaRosa, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated persons (Plantiffs) versus Evanger\\'s Dog and Cat Food Co., Inc., Holly N. Sher and Joel Sher (Defendants).  Don\\'t take my word on this, find out for yourself.<br /><br />The picture these events and reports formed in my mind was one of owners who were willing to do anything to make a buck, without regard to the legalities, consequences to their employees, or to their customers.  Maybe you will come to a different conclusion.  Maybe I  am over reacting.  But I want everyone considering their product to learn the facts, read the articles, and make an informed decision.<br /><br />I hope you find this to be useful.

I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.

Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a \"hot spot\" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an \"allergic reaction.\"  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It\\'s too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice.

Same as a peach Jolly Rancher, I like the flavor despite the slight artificial taste and aftertaste.  It is fun to watch the peach color spread quickly through the water without stirring.<br /><br />However, a few minutes after drinking a couple of glasses, I developed a sore throat with a burning sensation that caused me to keep swallowing for about twenty minutes so I won't be using it again and can't recommend it to others.<br /><br />The MIO packaging is novel.

The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added \"vanilla\" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.<br /><br />Another overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet\\'s coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.<br /><br />Thus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger\\'s, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.<br /><br />As a graduate student at U.C.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', \"I just don't like the taste...Other people might!?

She is also a picky eater, as are a fair amount of small dogs.<br />She loves the Merrick Wingaling, but one day while breaking up one of the large chunks of chicken, I was amazed to find a fairly stout chicken bone within the meat.  I removed it, thinking it must be an anomoly.

Many people have said on other dog sites that dogs can digest chicken bones.  That is true, if they can get them into their stomachs.  The problem arises on the scratches to the throat lining, then possible inflammation or infection, and at the worst, choking and not being able to dislodge a sharp piece of bone.

For starters, the Ginger Ale (and several others) keeps the essential oils in an alcohol suspension, yet is sold in a plastic bottle.  It doesn't take a chemist to figure out just how stupid that is.  Every bottle I've received has been partially collapsed, bubbled/sticky on the outside and has 'particulate matter' on the inside, due to the volume of alcohol migrating through the plastic.  Same with the Lemon flavor as well - it's been totally revolting.<br /><br />Avoid this - get the Ginger Beer instead of the Ginger Ale, use Koolaid unsweetened mixes for the fruit flavors, and really just use the Homebrew label for the Cola and RootBeer products.

The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.\", 'Whatever happened to Cal\\'s Tupelo Honey? I bought it for years in the natural food stores locally. None of them carry it anymore. Trying to locate the company, I spent a futile hour searching the Internet.<br /><br />The label on my old jar says \"Cairo, GA 39828\". Not to be found anywhere on Google, white pages or yellow. After checking Amazon, I see that the label on the 22 oz. bottles says \"Calvary, GA 31729\". Same non-results on Google. The local retailer suggests that they may have been bought out. It troubles me that they are unfindable.

When Merricks introduced its canned cat foods, they were truly out-standing.  There was no filler of excess liver, no bone, no cartlidge, no cheap grindings swimming in gravy--things which are typical of the majority of cat food producers.  There was minimum grain and lots of turkey, in addition to the obvious nutritious veggies and berries. Merricks truly was the King. However, as I continued to buy over time, I noticed a distinct degrading of quality.  I usually buy directly from the company\\'s website so I addressed these issues to them the day I found chunks of obvious poulty vertabra and cartlidge, large chunks--whole vertabra bones-- and ground, in a particular lot.  I had already seen the qualities of the foods going downhill but this addition of bone and cartlidge was upsetting. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and wrote to inform them that perhaps an \"accident\" had happened. They were cold, uncaring and wanted my remaining cans after I send them photographs of the foods, bones and cartlige matter and cans with the lot numbers clearly stamped. I admit I blew my stack at this attitude, but the last straw was receiving the final lot(which unfortunately I had ordered before the discovery of the literal garbage in the previous lot) and the result of the new came pouring out of the cans in a gray-ish brown mass of \"gravy\", with no visible pieces of turkey, just unhealthy-looking masses of liver and some cheap ground poultry that was hard and brittle to the fingers.  Merricks has been informed that they have a problem with quality control and the customer should be very aware that the lots differ dramatically. I\\'m very glad I kept and presevered the cans, bones and photographs as proof. If you want to pay premium prices for the kind of crap you throw away in your garbage every day then by all means buy Merricks and take a chance. It\\'s feast or famine from a company who has clearly taken advantage of the fact that most consumers really don\\'t bother looking at their cat\\'s food.

It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.

I don\\'t even taste it. Even tho I\\'m an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it\\'s NOT natural is \"NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME\". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from \\'natural sources\\'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it\\'s cheaper than from lemons. But it\\'s a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or \\'floor detergent flavor\\', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN\\'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists.

I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya\\'s coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it\\'s in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It\\'s hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I\\'ve had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico\\'s does not taste a THING like that.

I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn\\'t just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn\\'t had the Goya right there to redeem itself.', 'I\\'m disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so \"addictive.\" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats.

Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what\\'s happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog\\'s anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.

But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he\\'s consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it\\'s red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn\\'t been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn\\'t know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they\\'re having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we\\'ve been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don\\'t like it then don\\'t buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it\\'s appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn\\'t affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I\\'m sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.

So I went and purchased a new bag from a different store to see if the 1st bag was just a bad batch & this time the crunchies looked normal, however within a week, one of my cats got blood covered stool (which took 3 months to go away!), and my cat with the sensitive stomach started acting mopey & sick. After 2 weeks he would barely walk around. Several tests later the vet found that his intestines were swollen along with his stomach lymph nodes & he had developed pancreatitis.

Some companies are ethical and will admit when their food is processed in the same area or on the same equipment so people like my daughter have a choice of whether to risk their health or not.\", 'These are the worst gluten free cookies I have ever tasted.

I hope the good people at Nabisco decide not to give these a repeat appearance next fall.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but don't pay the absurd prices resellers are charging for this these.

Yuck...', 'Has a strange \"chemically\" taste that is really not identifiable as any sort of real fruit.  The instructions say to squeeze once per 8 oz. but, I can squeeze harder or softer and a different amount will come out so it is hard to know how much you are getting.  The product label design seems like it might be for kids with the bright colors, playful fonts, fruity flavors, and product name.  What is \"natural caffeine\" anyway?  Does that mean it is safe for anyone?  It needs to be refrigerated after opening.  You can\\'t take it around with you and add it to water you might get from a fountain or someplace.

Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that\\'s their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.

It can't be called chocolate flavored either because the white substance contains zero ingredients from the cocoa bean.<br /><br />An internet search for this vendor will show what the product really looks like, berries without leaves at times, easy saver fraud and so much more. There are a lot of other companies that really do make chocolate strawberries: this is not one of them.\", 'Up until now, I believed I was feeding my dogs a healthful treat that was good for them. Of note: the glucosamine and chondroitin content in these jerky treats is of the highest I\\'ve seen in a treat that they actually \"like\" and look forward to having.

Costco sells jerky treats made in China as well, and I no longer purchase those and warn my clients about purchasing them too. Only made in the USA and USDA inspected, as far as I\\'m concerned.<br /><br />Why oh why can\\'t pet owners find a decently priced, trustworthy jerky treat for our pets that is A. High in glucosamine and B. Isn\\'t manufactured in China? Being that China has shown little diligence with regards to creating a child\\'s toy that isn\\'t later involved in a recall, I\\'m certainly not about to give any credence to something that will be ingested by my pets.

At work one day, a friend offered me a Dunkin Donuts Watermelon coolatta. I didnt think I would care for a slush drink - but it was fantastic and soon, I was buying one every day. I have a home snow cone and slushy maker, so I went in search of a good Watermelon Syrup.<br /><br />I tried Monin, Torani, DaVinci, and Best Bargain brands Watermelon syrup. Let me warn you so you dont waste your money like I did - DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. #1, not even one of these products contains ANY Watermelon. They are all basically the same with Sugar, Lemon juice, Melon flavoring (NOT Watermelon), and red dye. NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them. I tried various quantities of the syrup from very little to a lot - and either way, they taste horrible! #3, you can EASILY make your own delicious Watermelon syrup. There are a number of recipies on the web. Some require rendering (boiling down) but you dont have to use those to get a very good homemade, TRUE tasting syrup.<br /><br />Avoid these products like the plague!!!<br /><br />Note - Dunkin Donuts does not seem to sell their syrup, however you can go to their web site and click the \"Contact Us\" button and send them a note that you would like to purchase their syrup (if you like it - and it is the best) and if you have a local shop, you can ask the manager if he/she wouldnt mind buying an extra one for you!<br /><br />Otherwise, make your own! Its the only way to get good taste. However, these products, Monin, Torani, DaVinci and Best Bargain are horrible and while they look like transmission fluid - I will wager THAT tastes better!', \"I am so glad they didn't send me the right amount.  There is no maple flavor at all.  Just a sugar coated stale cashew!.  The description says it's a 4 pack but they only sent 2.  I called and they asked if I wanted them to send me the other 2 packages or get a refund.  Well, they tasted terrible so I opted for the refund.
